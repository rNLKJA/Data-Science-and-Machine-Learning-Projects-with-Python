    "A recommendation system is one of the applications of data science that is used by almost any application or website today. Many websites today use a recommendation system to recommend articles to their readers. For example, Medium.com and even the website you’re currently reading this article on is also using a recommendation system to recommend articles to its readers.\n",

    "## Article Recommendation System\n",
    "There are many ways to create recommendation systems. To create an articles recommendation system, we need to focus on content rather than user interest. For example, if a user reads an article based on clustering, all recommended articles should also based on clustering. So to recommend articles based on the content:\n",
    "- we need to understand the content of the article\n",
    "- match the content with all other articles\n",
    "- and recommend the most suitable articles for the article that the reader is already reading\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we can use the concept of cosine similarity in machine learning. Cosine similarity is a method of buidling recommendation systems based on the content. It is used to find similarities between two different pieces of text documents. So we can use cosine similarity to build an article recommendation system. \n",
